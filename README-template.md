## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Learned:

How to collaborate on a project to deliver on a task with trello board backlog.

How to distribute different areas of expertise among a team.

How to ask for help/ recieve help when people of different experience levels come together.

How to develop our understanding of different/ new languages.

Soft learning/ self teaching on topics and learning by being "thrown into" a task after some practice.

That we want to hook up this front end program/ website to a database to do more backend development (with more JS training/ self teaching)






### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

As mentioned above, doing more database/ backend stuff would be interesting, otherwise we would like to host GitHub and use it in our portfolios.
